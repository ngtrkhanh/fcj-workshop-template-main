Great search improves conversion, AOV, and retention; 78% of users will buy again if experiences are personalized. With large catalogs, hybrid search is a strategic advantage.\nKeyword search: exact match on names/attributes. Semantic search: embeddings to capture meaning, resilient to phrasing, supports multimodal (text + image). Hybrid search: blends keyword + semantic scores; often improves quality 8–12% vs keyword and ~15% vs natural language (per OpenSearch). Amazon OpenSearch Service is the recommended vector database for Amazon Bedrock, delivering millisecond-latency vector search at scale. Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings G1 (via Bedrock) creates a shared embedding space for text and images, enabling cross-modal queries.\nGoal: Build a multimodal hybrid search solution that lets users submit text and/or images to retrieve relevant results from a sample retail image dataset.\nArchitecture overview Two main flows:\nIngestion: generate multimodal embeddings (text, image, metadata) with Bedrock (Titan) and store in OpenSearch. Query: OpenSearch search pipeline combines keyword + neural search; normalization processor standardizes and blends scores. Components:\nAmazon Bedrock (Titan Multimodal Embeddings G1) Amazon OpenSearch Service (vector + hybrid pipeline) Amazon S3 (source data) Amazon SageMaker Notebook (ingestion, testing) (Optional) SNS/SQS/Step Functions for orchestration Data ingestion Read text, images, metadata from S3; Base64-encode images. Send data to Bedrock (Titan) to get embeddings. Store embeddings + metadata into OpenSearch (bulk). Example index (shortened):\nsettings: index.knn: true number_of_shards: 2 mappings: properties: amazon_titan_multimodal_embeddings: type: knn_vector dimension: 1024 method: name: hnsw engine: lucene Query workflow Client sends text, Base64 image, or both. Pipeline runs: Keyword search (multi_match). Neural search (Titan embeddings for text/image). Normalization (e.g., min_max) + combination (arithmetic_mean) to blend scores. Return ranked results. Example search pipeline:\n{ \u0026#34;phase_results_processors\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;normalization-processor\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;normalization\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;technique\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;min_max\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;combination\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;technique\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;arithmetic_mean\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;parameters\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;weights\u0026#34;: [OPENSEARCH_KEYWORD_WEIGHT, 1 - OPENSEARCH_KEYWORD_WEIGHT] } } } } ] } Hybrid query example:\n{ \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;hybrid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;queries\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;multi_match\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;query_text\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;neural\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;vector_embedding\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;query_text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;query_text\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;query_image\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;base64_image\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;model_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;titan_connector_model_id\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;k\u0026#34;: 5 } } } ] } } } Prerequisites AWS account. Bedrock with Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings G1 enabled. OpenSearch Service domain. SageMaker notebook. Familiarity with IAM, EC2, OpenSearch, SageMaker, Python. Sample code on GitHub. Create the Amazon Bedrock connector in OpenSearch Service IAM role allowing bedrock:InvokeModel for Titan Multimodal Embeddings G1; trust opensearchservice.amazonaws.com. Register model group, create connector, deploy model in OpenSearch (deploy=true). Build the search pipeline \u0026amp; enable hybrid search Use normalization (min_max) + combination (arithmetic_mean) to merge keyword/semantic scores. Tune OPENSEARCH_KEYWORD_WEIGHT as needed. Ingest sample data Select fields for embeddings; Base64 images; generate Titan embeddings; bulk into the index. Sample dataset: retail products (images + metadata). Create query functions for testing Keyword search: multi_match with query_text. Semantic search: neural with query_text, query_image, model_id. Hybrid search: combine both via the pipeline. Test observations Keyword: exact on names/attributes, misses context. Semantic: understands context, may overweight image vs. color. Hybrid: blended scoring surfaces the most relevant (right color + style). Cleanup Delete index, model deployment, model, model group, Bedrock connector; if you created a dedicated domain for the lab, delete it or remove test resources to avoid costs.\nConclusion Multimodal hybrid search on OpenSearch Service combines keyword + semantic strengths using Titan Multimodal Embeddings G1 (Bedrock). It supports text + image queries for more accurate, relevant results. Try the notebook, tune normalization/weights. For custom models on SageMaker, see “Hybrid Search with Amazon OpenSearch Service”; for semantic-only, see Bedrock + OpenSearch guides for text and image search.\nAbout the authors Renan Bertolazzi – Enterprise Solutions Architect at AWS, helps customers innovate and simplify.

Gartner notes that organizations promoting data sharing outperform peers on business value metrics. A simple access-and-share mechanism is essential, yet cross-account permissions and finding the right data across accounts are common challenges when publishing and consuming data products on AWS.\nAmazon DataZone is a fully managed data management service to catalog, discover, share, and govern data across AWS.\nSolution overview This solution enables cross-account collaboration using Amazon DataZone domain association while preserving security and governance. We publish data assets via the Amazon DataZone business data catalog so other accounts can discover them, then query those assets from another AWS account using tools such as Amazon Athena and the Amazon Redshift query editor.\nProducer account: hosts data assets and the Amazon DataZone domain. Consumer account: needs access to producer data. Domain association uses AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM). If both accounts are in the same AWS Organizations organization, association is automatic; otherwise AWS RAM sends an invitation for the consumer to accept or decline. Personas:\nData administrators: own producer/consumer; create the domain, configure/accept domain associations. Data publishers: in producer; create publish projects/environments, produce/publish assets, approve subscription requests. Data subscribers: in consumer; create subscribe projects/environments, discover/subscribe to assets, query data for insights. Prerequisites Two AWS accounts: producer and consumer. An Amazon Redshift provisioned cluster or Redshift Serverless workgroup in each account, provisioned by a data admin. A secret in AWS Secrets Manager storing master user credentials for each Redshift cluster/workgroup. Data admins create secrets; publishers/subscribers obtain secret ARNs when creating environments/profiles. Amazon DataZone uses Amazon Redshift datashares for cross-account sharing; both producer and consumer clusters must be encrypted and use supported RA3 types (ra3.16xlarge, ra3.4xlarge, ra3.xlplus) or Redshift Serverless. See datashare considerations for encryption. High-level steps:\nCreate Amazon DataZone domain in producer. Send domain association request from producer to consumer. Accept domain association in consumer. Add data users to the domain. Create publish projects for AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift (producer). Create Glue and Redshift environments to publish assets (producer). Create and run data sources for Glue/Redshift to publish assets to the business catalog. Create subscribe projects for Glue/Redshift (consumer). Create environment profiles/environments for Glue/Redshift in subscribe projects. Subscribe to Glue/Redshift tables and consume via Athena and Redshift query editor. Create Amazon DataZone domain (producer) Log in to the producer console as data admin. Create domain Demo_cross_account_domain (Quick setup enables default blueprints and environment profiles for data lake and data warehouse). Request domain association (producer → consumer) In the producer Amazon DataZone console, open the domain, go to Associated Accounts, enter consumer account ID(s), choose Request association. Use policy AWS RAM DataZonePortalReadWrite so consumer users can call Amazon DataZone APIs and use the data portal. Accept domain association (consumer) Log in to consumer (same Region), open Amazon DataZone → View requests → select domain → Review request → Accept association. Domain shows associated. Enable environment blueprints: select domain → Blueprints → enable DefaultDataLake (provide Glue Manage Access role) and DefaultDataWarehouse. Add data users to the domain As data admin in producer: User management → Add → Add IAM users. Add publisher IAM users from the current account; add subscriber IAM users from the associated consumer account. Create publish projects (producer) Data publisher in producer creates projects in the data portal: Glue_Publish_Project (AWS Glue assets) Redshift_Publish_Project (Amazon Redshift assets) Create publish environments (producer) Glue In demo_cross_account_domain, open Glue_Publish_Project, create environment Glue_Publish_Environment with default DataLakeProfile. Leave producer_glue_db_name, consumer_glue_db_name, Workgroup_name blank. Open Athena (Analytics tools), ensure Glue_Publish_Environment and database glue_publish_environment_pub_db. Run CTAS to create sample table mkt_sls_table (sales/marketing sample). Verify the table exists. Redshift In Redshift_Publish_Project, create environment Redshift_Publish_Environment with default data warehouse profile. Provide Redshift cluster/workgroup, database name, and secret ARN. Secrets must include tags: Cluster: DataZone.rs.cluster: \u0026lt;cluster:db\u0026gt; Serverless: DataZone.rs.workgroup: \u0026lt;workgroup:db\u0026gt; AmazonDataZoneProject: \u0026lt;project_id\u0026gt; AmazonDataZoneDomain: \u0026lt;domain_id\u0026gt; In Redshift query editor, create table rs_sls_tbl via CTAS (sample sales data). Verify the table exists. Publish assets to the business data catalog (producer) Glue data source In Glue_Publish_Project → Glue_Publish_Environment, create data source glue-publish-datasource, type AWS Glue, select environment, database glue_publish_environment_pub_db, table selection *. Run on demand; after run, mkt_sls_table appears. Review metadata → Accept All → Publish Asset. Redshift data source In Redshift_Publish_Project → Redshift_Publish_Environment, create data source rs-publish-datasource, type Amazon Redshift. Provide cluster/workgroup and secret; select database dev, schema datazone_env_redshift_publish_environment. Run on demand; after run, rs_sls_tbl appears. Review metadata → Accept All → Publish Asset. Create subscribe projects (consumer) In consumer data portal, create: Glue_Subscribe_Project (for AWS Glue assets) Redshift_Subscribe_Project (for Amazon Redshift assets) Create environment profiles and environments (consumer) Glue Create environment profile glue_subscribe-env-profile: Blueprint Default Data Lake; account = consumer; Authorized projects = All; Publishing = Publish from any database. Create environment glue_subscribe_environment from the profile (optional: producer/consumer Glue DB names, workgroup). Wait until complete. Redshift In Redshift_Subscribe_Project, create profile redshift_subscribe-env-profile: Blueprint Default Data Warehouse; Parameter set = Enter my own; choose Cluster or Serverless; provide Redshift secret ARN; Authorized projects = All; Publishing = Publish any schema. Create environment redshift_subscribe_environment from the profile. Subscribe to AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift tables Glue subscription As data subscriber (consumer), open Glue_Subscribe_Project, select Market Sales Table (mkt_sls_table) → Subscribe with justification. Publisher approves; subscriber confirms in Subscribed Assets. Open Amazon Athena (environment glue_subscribe_environment, DB glue_subscribe_environment_sub_db), preview mkt_sls_table and verify data. Redshift subscription In Redshift_Subscribe_Project, search Sales Table (rs_sls_tbl) → Subscribe with justification. Publisher approves; subscriber confirms in Subscribed Assets. Open Redshift Query Editor V2 via project link, create a connection with temporary IAM credentials, select DB for the environment, and run:\nSELECT * FROM \u0026quot;dev\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;datazone_env_redshift_subscribe_environment\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;rs_sls_tbl\u0026quot;; Cleanup Delete Amazon DataZone projects created for the walkthrough. Delete the Amazon DataZone domain if it was created for the lab. Delete Redshift clusters/workgroups and related Secrets Manager secrets in both producer and consumer accounts. Summary Cross-account data sharing is complex due to permissions and security. This solution shows how to publish and consume data across AWS accounts using Amazon DataZone with AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift, maintaining consistent governance and secure access. You can monitor access/activity with AWS Lake Formation and CloudTrail (90-day default logs). Extend the pattern to more accounts as needed.\nAbout the authors Arun Pradeep Selvaraj – Senior Solutions Engineer at AWS; focuses on digital transformation and cloud modernization.

High-Level System Architecture The Aurora system is built entirely on a Serverless architecture on AWS, optimizing both scalability and operational cost.\nIt integrates with Google Cloud Platform to provide a seamless Single Sign-On (SSO) experience via Google authentication.\nMain Components: Frontend (Client):\nA Web App (SPA) where users interact with the system, view schedules, and create tasks.\nAuthentication Layer:\nGoogle Cloud Project: Provides OAuth 2.0 Client ID/Secret to authenticate Gmail users. Amazon Cognito: Acts as the federated Identity Provider (IdP), managing the User Pool and issuing temporary AWS credentials to the Frontend. Backend Logic (Compute):\nAWS Lambda: Hosts business logic functions (Create Event, Update Tasks, Trigger Email Notifications). Database:\nAmazon DynamoDB: Stores Events and Daily Worklogs.\nUses UserId as the Partition Key to isolate each user\u0026rsquo;s data securely. Notification Service:\nEmail Sending Logic: Triggered by Lambda when a new event is created or when the scheduled time arrives.\nSends HTML-formatted emails using SES or a custom Email API. 2. Authentication Flow This flow ensures that only authenticated users can access their personal data.\nAurora uses Cognito Federated Identities combined with Google OAuth 2.0.\nStep-by-step Process: User Login:\nThe user clicks “Sign in with Google” on the Frontend.\nGoogle OAuth:\nThe user is redirected to Google’s login page.\nAfter a successful login, Google returns an Id Token (JWT).\nToken Exchange:\nThe Frontend sends the Id Token to Amazon Cognito.\nVerification \u0026amp; Session Handling:\nCognito validates the Token with Google. If the token is valid:\nCognito creates/updates the corresponding user profile in the User Pool. Cognito returns temporary AWS credentials (Access Key, Secret Key, Session Token) to the Frontend. Authorized Requests:\nThe Frontend uses these credentials to access API resources (via API Gateway or directly invoking Lambda/DynamoDB through AWS SDK) with permissions defined in IAM Roles.\n3. Data Flow: Creating an Event \u0026amp; Sending Email Notifications When a user creates a new event (e.g., “Team Meeting at 9:00 AM”), the data flow proceeds as follows:\nFrontend → API Request:\nThe frontend sends a POST request containing the event details to the API endpoint.\nAWS Lambda Trigger:\nThe Lambda function is invoked and performs:\nInput validation Writing event data to DynamoDB (Table: AuroraEvents) Email Notification Trigger:\nAfter writing to DynamoDB, Lambda triggers the email-sending logic. The system generates an HTML email body. The Email Service (SES/Gmail API/Resend) sends the message to the user’s inbox. 💡 Highlight: Integrating Google Login eliminates the need for users to manage an additional password, while benefiting from Google’s built-in two-factor authentication for enhanced security.\n"},{"uri":"https://ngtrkhanh.github.io/fcj-workshop-template-main/4-eventparticipated/4.2-event2/","title":"Discover Agentic AI – Amazon QuickSuite Workshop","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Discover Agentic AI – Amazon QuickSuite Workshop - Date: November 7, 2025 - Location: AWS Vietnam Office, Bitexco Financial Tower, HCMC\nEvent Overview An exclusive workshop focused on the shift from passive Generative AI to autonomous Agentic AI.

Working Environment\nThe work environment is exceptionally welcoming and open. FCJ team members consistently offer support whenever I face challenges, even beyond regular working hours. The workspace is well-organized and comfortable, which significantly enhances my ability to concentrate.\n2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin\nThe mentor delivers comprehensive guidance, provides clear explanations when I\u0026rsquo;m uncertain, and consistently encourages me to ask questions. The team mentor assists with various issues I encounter, ensuring smooth workflow. I particularly value the mentor\u0026rsquo;s approach of allowing me to experiment and independently resolve problems rather than simply providing solutions.\n3. Alignment Between Work and Academic Field\nThe assignments I received match the knowledge I acquired during my university studies, while simultaneously introducing me to entirely new domains I hadn\u0026rsquo;t explored before. As a result, I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to reinforce my foundational understanding while acquiring hands-on practical skills.\n4. Learning \u0026amp; Skill Development Opportunities\nThroughout the internship period, I\u0026rsquo;ve gained numerous new competencies including project management tool usage, collaborative teamwork abilities, and professional communication within a corporate setting. The mentor has also shared extensive real-world insights that have better guided my career direction.\n5. Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe company culture is highly positive: mutual respect among colleagues, serious work ethic, and collective effort with mutual support.\n6. Policies / Benefits for Interns\nThe company provides flexible scheduling arrangements when necessary. Additionally, the opportunity to participate in internal training sessions represents a significant advantage.\nAdditional Questions What were you most satisfied with during your internship?\nThe most satisfying aspect was the final four weeks, when I had the opportunity to build a complete microservices system (Program Service and Chat Service) from scratch. Witnessing the complex business logic I designed—such as the Streak system and Slip/Relapse mechanisms—functioning accurately was an incredibly rewarding experience. It transformed theoretical knowledge into a tangible, functional product.\nWhat do you think the company should improve for future interns?\nI believe the internship program would be more effective with a structured training roadmap from the beginning, helping interns better understand the company\u0026rsquo;s actual work and their role within projects. Receiving step-by-step guidance, from work processes to implementing real-world tasks, would enable interns to integrate more quickly into the professional work environment.\nFurthermore, having clearer direction on essential DevOps skills, as well as an overview of the AWS services the company utilizes, would help interns build a solid foundation for long-term growth. I also hope the program could provide detailed documentation or competency frameworks to guide those interested in pursuing DevOps roles in the future.\nIf recommending to friends, would you encourage them to intern here? Why?\nAbsolutely. I would highly recommend it to others. This isn\u0026rsquo;t an internship where you\u0026rsquo;re limited to trivial tasks. You\u0026rsquo;re entrusted with a real, challenging project and given the trust to build it. The learning curve is steep, but the practical experience you gain in cloud architecture, backend development, and professional software engineering practices is invaluable. The dedicated support from mentors creates an ideal environment for growth.\nSuggestions \u0026amp; Expectations What suggestions do you have to improve the internship experience?\nI suggest expanding the office space to allow more interns the opportunity to interact directly with each other and experience working in an office environment more frequently.\nWould you like to continue with this program in the future?\nYes, I\u0026rsquo;m very interested in continuing with FCJ, whether through another internship program. I feel a strong connection to the project I\u0026rsquo;ve built and the infrastructure deployed on AWS, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited about the possibility of further developing it—potentially implementing features, optimizing workflows, or the Video Call functionality mentioned in the original proposal—while continuing personal growth and learning new valuable skills.\nOther Comments (free sharing):\nI\u0026rsquo;m truly grateful for this opportunity. This internship has been a pivotal moment in my professional development. It not only strengthened my technical skills but also gave me the confidence to tackle complex real-world software engineering challenges. Thank you to the mentor and the entire team for their guidance and support.\n"},{"uri":"https://ngtrkhanh.github.io/fcj-workshop-template-main/1-worklog/1.8-week8/","title":"Week 8 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":" ⚠️ Note: The information below is for reference only.

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The work environment is exceptionally welcoming and open. FCJ team members consistently offer support whenever I face challenges, even beyond regular working hours. The workspace is well-organized and comfortable, which significantly enhances my ability to concentrate.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentor delivers comprehensive guidance, provides clear explanations when I'm uncertain, and consistently encourages me to ask questions. The team mentor assists with various issues I encounter, ensuring smooth workflow. I particularly value the mentor's approach of allowing me to experiment and independently resolve problems rather than simply providing solutions.

**3. Alignment Between Work and Academic Field**  
The assignments I received match the knowledge I acquired during my university studies, while simultaneously introducing me to entirely new domains I hadn't explored before. As a result, I've been able to reinforce my foundational understanding while acquiring hands-on practical skills.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
Throughout the internship period, I've gained numerous new competencies including project management tool usage, collaborative teamwork abilities, and professional communication within a corporate setting. The mentor has also shared extensive real-world insights that have better guided my career direction.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is highly positive: mutual respect among colleagues, serious work ethic, and collective effort with mutual support.

**6. Policies / Benefits for Interns**  
The company provides flexible scheduling arrangements when necessary. Additionally, the opportunity to participate in internal training sessions represents a significant advantage.

### Additional Questions

- **What were you most satisfied with during your internship?**  
  The most satisfying aspect was the final four weeks, when I had the opportunity to build a complete microservices system (`Program Service` and `Chat Service`) from scratch. Witnessing the complex business logic I designed—such as the Streak system and Slip/Relapse mechanisms—functioning accurately was an incredibly rewarding experience. It transformed theoretical knowledge into a tangible, functional product.

- **What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**  
  I believe the internship program would be more effective with a structured training roadmap from the beginning, helping interns better understand the company's actual work and their role within projects. Receiving step-by-step guidance, from work processes to implementing real-world tasks, would enable interns to integrate more quickly into the professional work environment.

  Furthermore, having clearer direction on essential DevOps skills, as well as an overview of the AWS services the company utilizes, would help interns build a solid foundation for long-term growth. I also hope the program could provide detailed documentation or competency frameworks to guide those interested in pursuing DevOps roles in the future.

- **If recommending to friends, would you encourage them to intern here? Why?**  
  Absolutely. I would highly recommend it to others. This isn't an internship where you're limited to trivial tasks. You're entrusted with a real, challenging project and given the trust to build it. The learning curve is steep, but the practical experience you gain in cloud architecture, backend development, and professional software engineering practices is invaluable. The dedicated support from mentors creates an ideal environment for growth.

### Suggestions & Expectations

- **What suggestions do you have to improve the internship experience?**  
  I suggest expanding the office space to allow more interns the opportunity to interact directly with each other and experience working in an office environment more frequently.

- **Would you like to continue with this program in the future?**  
  Yes, I'm very interested in continuing with FCJ, whether through another internship program. I feel a strong connection to the project I've built and the infrastructure deployed on AWS, and I'm excited about the possibility of further developing it—potentially implementing features, optimizing workflows, or the Video Call functionality mentioned in the original proposal—while continuing personal growth and learning new valuable skills.

- **Other Comments (free sharing):**  
  I'm truly grateful for this opportunity. This internship has been a pivotal moment in my professional development. It not only strengthened my technical skills but also gave me the confidence to tackle complex real-world software engineering challenges. Thank you to the mentor and the entire team for their guidance and support.

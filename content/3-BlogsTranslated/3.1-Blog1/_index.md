# Launch of the Cloud Innovation Center at the University of Pittsburgh

Every year, cloud technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) continue to reshape how universities, researchers, and public sector organizations solve their most complex challenges. In a milestone collaboration that is set to transform both health sciences research and athletic performance, the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have announced the launch of the **Health Sciences and Sports Analytics Cloud Innovation Center (CIC)** — operated by AWS.

This is the **first CIC on the East Coast** of the United States and the first center dedicated specifically to **health sciences and sports analytics**, marking a significant advancement in how cloud technology and AI can be applied to these rapidly evolving fields.

## Pioneering innovation in medicine and sports

The new CIC will leverage AWS’s full suite of machine learning and AI tools, including **Amazon SageMaker** and **Amazon Bedrock**, to develop cutting-edge solutions for real-world challenges.

> “At AWS, we believe innovation happens when technology is paired with curious minds ready to solve big problems,”  
> — **Valerie Singer**, Global Director for Education at AWS.

She added that combining Pitt’s deep expertise in health sciences with AWS’s cloud capabilities creates a powerful “flywheel effect” that accelerates continuous innovation. Together, AWS and Pitt aim to improve medical outcomes and elevate student-athlete performance. This partnership represents exactly the type of collaboration capable of delivering breakthrough results.

## A hub for innovation in a transforming city

The establishment of the new Cloud Innovation Center builds on Pittsburgh’s long-standing legacy of reinvention — from a historic industrial hub to a modern center for technology, medicine, and data science.

Through this initiative:

- **Students** gain hands-on experience with cloud and AI technologies, preparing them for leadership roles in the digital economy.  
- **Researchers** gain access to scalable AWS infrastructure to accelerate groundbreaking discoveries in the health sciences.  
- **Athletic programs** begin leveraging real-time data and analytics to enhance performance, strategy, and training outcomes.  
- **Open-source solutions** developed within the CIC will benefit communities far beyond the campus.

## Student-led innovation

Like the successful CICs at **Arizona State University**, **University of British Columbia**, and **California Polytechnic State University**, Pitt’s CIC will follow a **student-driven innovation model**.

Through rapid prototyping and iterative experimentation, students across previous CICs have already developed more than **150 open-source solutions** addressing public sector challenges — while building advanced technical skills and contributing tangible value to their communities.

At Pitt, enthusiasm is already high, with the first cohort of interns beginning their work in mid-April 2025.

> “Working with AWS and backend technologies has always fascinated me, and the CIC’s focus on solving real-world problems with these tools is exactly what drew me in,”  
> — **Mohammed Misran**, CIC Intern.

> “I’m excited to dive deeper and contribute to impactful projects. My goal isn’t just to develop technical skills — it’s to maximize innovation and solve complex problems that traditional methods struggle to address… for Pitt!”

## Looking ahead

With its official launch today, the Pitt–AWS CIC opens a promising new chapter in innovation for both **health sciences** and **sports analytics**.

The collaboration between AWS and the University of Pittsburgh is poised to accelerate the development of AI-driven solutions while preparing the next generation of technology leaders.

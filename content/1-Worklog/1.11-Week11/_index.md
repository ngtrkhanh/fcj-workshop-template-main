### Week 11 Objectives:

* Design and build a small mini project on AWS.
* Combine multiple services such as VPC, EC2, S3, and RDS.
* Test basic end-to-end functionality of the system.

### Week 11 Achievements:

* Designed and built a small AWS mini project that included:
  * A VPC with appropriate subnets and networking
  * EC2 instances for application compute
  * S3 for static file storage
  * RDS for managed relational database

* Connected the components together:
  * EC2 application instances connected to RDS for data persistence
  * S3 used to serve or store static assets

* Tested basic end-to-end functionality:
  * Connectivity between EC2 and RDS
  * Read/write data to the database
  * Access static content where applicable

* Documented the mini project architecture and main design decisions.

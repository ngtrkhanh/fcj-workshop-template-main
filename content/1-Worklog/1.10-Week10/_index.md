### Week 10 Achievements:

* Learned high-level CI/CD concepts and how they apply on AWS.

* Explored AWS CodePipeline components:
  * Source, build, and deploy stages
  * Integrations with CodeCommit and other services

* Created a simple CodePipeline:
  * Used CodeCommit as the source repository
  * Configured a basic deployment stage (for example, to EC2 or S3)

* Tested automatic deployment by pushing new commits and observing CodePipeline executions and status.

### Week 9 Achievements:

* Learned the basics of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and how CloudFormation fits into AWS automation.

* Studied CloudFormation building blocks:
  * Templates, resources, parameters, mappings, outputs
  * Stacks and stack lifecycle (create, update, delete)

* Created a small CloudFormation template to provision a simple resource set (such as a VPC or EC2 instance).

* Deployed and managed a stack:
  * Launched the stack from the template
  * Observed events and resource creation
  * Tested updating and deleting the stack

* Documented lessons learned and best practices for starting with IaC on AWS.

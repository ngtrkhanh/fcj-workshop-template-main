I participated in the "Cessation Support Platform" project, where I significantly strengthened and expanded my technical capabilities across multiple domains:

* **API Development & Integration**: Built and managed secure and scalable APIs using Amazon API Gateway, ensuring efficient communication between frontend and backend services.

* **Authentication & User Management**: Implemented user authentication and authorization with AWS Cognito, enabling secure sign-up, sign-in, and session handling.

* **Frontend Development**: Contributed to building the web interface by integrating APIs, handling user interactions, and ensuring smooth communication between the client side and backend services.

* **Cloud Deployment**: Leveraged AWS Amplify to deploy and manage the frontend application, improving deployment speed and simplifying environment configuration.

* **Database Management**: Designed and maintained a non-relational database using MongoDB, managing collections for user data, social interactions, and platform activity logs.

* **Analysis & Problem-Solving**: Interpreted project requirements, tackled technical challenges such as API integration issues and data-handling complexities, and delivered practical solutions to maintain system stability.

Regarding my professional conduct, I consistently aimed to complete my tasks with high quality, followed established team workflows, and maintained proactive communication with teammates to ensure the project moved in the right direction.
